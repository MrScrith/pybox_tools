# pybox_tools
Tools for compiling code for the PyBox CPU project

The CPU for this code can be found in my processor_test java project, eventually I would like both a physical implementation (FPGA of some sort) and a Minecraft implementation (similer functionality to the computer in the Redpower 2 mod, except not using the Forth programming language, something more C like).

This repo will be fleshed out a bit more to include a compiler, documentation, and any other tools I deem necessary for writing code for the PyBox CPU.
